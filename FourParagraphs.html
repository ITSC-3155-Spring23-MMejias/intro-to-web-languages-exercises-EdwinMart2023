    <p style="background-color:red;">While the young hero is arguably best known for starring in the Static Shock animated series and the Young Justice cartoon, most people are unaware of just how powerful he really is. </p>

    <p style="background-color:black;">This is a real pity, as Static is one of DC's most powerful young heroes and has more superpowers than almost anyone on the Justice League, with each of his abilities is even better than the last.</p>

    <p style="background-color:red;">This is a pretty cool power, albeit a fairly basic one and is based on biology. Some aquatic creatures in real life can communicate with one another by transmitting weak electronic signals between each other.</p>

    <p style="background-color:black;">Static can do this, albeit by sending signals into electronic devicesâ€”as most human biology is not exactly built to receive electromagnetic waves of language. He is basically a human radio, cell phone, and walkie-talkie rolled into one.</p>
