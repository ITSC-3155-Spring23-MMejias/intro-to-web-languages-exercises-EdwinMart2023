<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p style="font-family:verdana">Distributed by DC until 1997 but never crossing with the publisher's main continuity (at first), the imprint was created specifically to tell stories about superheroes who fall under cultural minority groups, such as Icon - an alien who takes the form of a Black man and becomes a crime fighter while stranded on Earth.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Milestone Comics was founded by Dwayne McDuffie, Denys Cowan, Michael Davis, and Derek T. Dingle, who also created the character of Static with writer Robert Lee Washington III </p>
